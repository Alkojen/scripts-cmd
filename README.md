Utilities scripts .bat 

All the scripts found on this repository are utilities created by me, as a practice. So they are usefull but simple. They will become more complex as I adquire more
knowledge about Windows and cmd.

LIST OF SCRIPTS

1. hashcheck.bat

This script is used for compare the hash of a file with the hash-key introduced as a parameter on the command:

Syntax:  hashcheck.bat [file-directory] [hash-key]

At this moment it only compares with MD5, but this will change in the future as I said.
